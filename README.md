<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Larissa Fernanda Espindola Fonseca</h1>
<h3 align="center">I hold a degree in Business Administration and my dream is to see the world! I am a Software Quality Analysis. My main goal in life is geographic freedom and to achieve it, I recently did a QA Analyst Bootcamp at TripleTen, from which I graduated and i learned how to ensure software quality. The subjects covered in the course are efficient, broad and practical and completely focused on the day-to-day work routine of a QA. The following were addressed:
 - Test documentation - Requirements analysis - Test checklist - Test case - WEB interface tests and API Testing (front and back-end), Knowledge of: HTML structure, JSON format, REST, SQL database, among others Tools: draw.io, Figma, Swagger, Jira, Postman In parallel to manual testing, I am dedicating myself to learning automated testing. Now I find myself in a career transition to the technology area, and I'm looking for an opportunity as a junior QA to start on this new journey. I have a lot of experience with customer service as I have worked in this area for 12 years. I have advanced English and my strong point is definitely communication. I know how to work in a team and I am very proactive. I am very excited and focused on learning, adding and applying my knowledge to the team that gives me this opportunity!</h3>
