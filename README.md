<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹,

#### I'm Larissa Fernanda Espindola Fonseca :smile: </h1>
<h align="">

I am a Software Quality Analysis and my dream is to see the world! I hold a degree in Business Administration and my main goal in life is geographic freedom, and to achieve it, I recently did a QA Bootcamp at TripleTen, from which I graduated and i learned how to ensure software quality. The subjects covered in the course are efficient, broad and practical and completely focused on the day-to-day work routine of a QA. **The following were addressed:**

:rocket:
**- Test documentation**
**- Requirements analysis**
**- Test checklist** 
**- Test case** 
**- WEB interface tests and API Testing - (front and back-end)**

ðŸ’¡ **Knowledge of: HTML structure, JSON format, REST, SQL database** 

**Tools: draw.io, Figma, Swagger, Jira, Postman** :rocket:

In parallel to manual testing, I am dedicating myself to learning automated testing. Now I find myself in a career transition and I'm looking for an opportunity as a junior QA to start on this new journey. **I have a lot of experience with customer service as I have worked in this area for 12 years. I have advanced English and my strong point is definitely communication**. I know how to work in a team and I am very proactive. I am very excited and focused on learning, adding and applying my knowledge to the team that gives me this opportunity! .</h3>
